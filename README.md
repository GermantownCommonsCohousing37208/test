test of Github for Germantown Commons Cohousing document archive

## need

Germantown Commons now has quite a few documents that should be part of a searchable online archive. Although Basecamp.com has some search facilities, there are so many documents mixed together, it is difficult to discern which is the final version and when changes were made (by whom, etc.). Certain documents need to be in our archive. Others don't.

## proposal

Germantown Commons can establish a searchable archive using github.com to create a public archive and allow us to track changes to important documents over time. For public projects, Github doesn't charge anything. Consequently, the only cost of such a project is the time and effort of those who would set it up.

## conditions to be tested

1. Is a public archive on github actually searchable in a way that would be useful to us?

* How much special training or software would be necessary?

* Would it be possible to find efficiently what we want to find?

* Does a person have to have a github account before they can search the archive?

2. Is it easy enough to post documents to the archive?

* What special knowledge or credentials are required? (Markdown? Does each person who wants to post something have to have a github personal account? (If so, that might be a dealbreaker.))

3. Is an archive *too searchable*? Would information about community members show up in a general google search for their names? If so, would this be a privacy issue? (Does Basecamp info not show up in the same way?) Would this mean we should have a private (and therefore not free) github account?
